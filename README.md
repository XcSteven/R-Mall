# Group introduction:
Github URL of the group's repo: https://github.com/XcSteven/WPasm1/
Our team has 3 members:
- Bui Nguyen Ngoc Tuan: Leader of the group (double-check everything committed by the members), in charge of the Mall pages.
- Vo Tran Khanh Linh: in charge of the Clothes Store pages.
- Duong Tuan Nghia: in charge of the Food Store pages. </br>
Even though our work is divided detailedly, cross-helping among members is also allowed, as this is a complex assignment. </br>
Our website is called "R-Mall", with the two stores being "R-Clothes" and "R-Food". The main purpose of our website is to showcase which products we have in store. There will be a total of 20 or more pages, each with their own purposes to help navigate the customers through our R-Mall. For instance, the "Contact" page is for the customers to reach out to us, by leaving us comments and questions, etc. Hope you will find our website useful and interesting to use.
